It's ok if you want to use this firebase config if you got a have a possitive contribution.

Using AngularFire to do popup facebook login.

There's 3 pages, ProfilePage, JualPage(SellPage), BeliPage(BuyPage)

My idea is to have an 'add' button on the right of nav header, add Jual for Jual(sell) page

Title, category, description, price, time stamp for the jual node

With the updated jual list displayed on the jual page

The same for the beli(buy) page

Anyway that's a start
